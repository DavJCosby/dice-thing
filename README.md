# Dice Thing
Allows the user to roll an $n$-sided dice repeatedly, and then tells you the probability of your highest streak as the program runs. The user defines an integer $k < n$ such that all rolls greater than $k$ will continue the streak.

```
How many sides should the die have? 10
How many of those sides should break the streak? 1

After running for a little bit...
```
Each roll has a 9 in 10 chance of continuing the streak.
